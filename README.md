# dataStructures-C
A list of all data structures implemented in C language

Please make sure to follow these guidelines since this is an educational repository:
- Don't name variables in the format of `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`, `n`, as they can be confusing. Rather name them so that it tells it's purpose, like `firstElementOfArray`, `sizeOfArray`, `nthTerm`, `middleTerm`
- Use Camel Casing
- Comment explaing each part of the program
- Don't write data structure logic inside the `main()` function. Add them in a separate function so that it can be easily used.
